each start up will consist of the following steps after setup is complete
	1- in terminal type - cd angular-phonecat
	2- change step of tutorial - git checkout -f step-0
	3- in seperate terminal - cd angular-phonecat and then - npm start to start server
	4- go to http://http://localhost:8000/app/
	5- npm test for karma - npm run protractor for e2e testing (1st terminal)



SETUP
	step:
	1)download angular-phonecat:
		*git clone --depth=14 https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git
	2)change directory
		*cd angular-phonecat
	3)install Node.Js
		-go to website http://nodejs.org/download
		-check version in git console
			*node --version
	4)download tool dependencies (bower)
		*npm install
	5)npm helper scripts to run common tasks that are needed while developing
		*npm start (start a local development web-server)
		*npm test (start the karma unit test runner)
		*npm run protractor (run the protractor end to end (e2e) tests
		*npm run update-webdriver (install the drivers needed by protractor
	6)after running npm start, the site is located at
		http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
	7)run unit tests with (karma will read configuration file at test/karma.conf.js)
		*npm test
		its good to leave this running all the time for live feedback during development about whether changes 

pass the unit tests
	8)install drivers for e2e tests (only do once)
		*npm run update-webdriver
		when running e2e test, first npm start, then npm run protractor

1 - STATIC TEMPLATE
	normally a page would be generated with the following html code
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>Nexus S</span>
    <p>
      Fast just got faster with Nexus S.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Motorola XOOMâ„¢ with Wi-Fi</span>
    <p>
      The Next, Next Generation tablet.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

2 - ANGULAR TEMPLATES
	here the same code is simplified with angular
<html ng-app="phonecatApp">
<head>
  ...
  <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="js/controllers.js"></script>
</head>
<body ng-controller="PhoneListCtrl">

  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="phone in phones">
      <span>{{phone.name}}</span>
      <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

ng-repeat says to gather all the 'phone' variables in the phones object and for each one, <span> will show the phone name 

and <p> will show the phone snippet(about the phone). each phone will be created in an <li> element.

simple test for this code would be:
describe('PhoneListCtrl', function(){

  it('should create "phones" model with 3 phones', function() {
    var scope = {},
        ctrl = new PhoneListCtrl(scope);

    expect(scope.phones.length).toBe(3);
  });

});

when ng-repeat used in a table, it added new table elements for each array. Assuming ng-repeat duplicates the element it 

was added to when repeating the array. where {{i}} is placed, the array item gets repeatedly created with the next array 

along with the parent element and any element in between {{i}} and ng-repeat="i in..."
<table>
  <tr><th>row number</th></tr>
  <tr ng-repeat="i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"><td>{{i}}
  </td></tr>
</table>

EXTRA POINTS: try and make an 8x8 table using an additional ng-repeat
<tr ng-repeat="x in [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]">{{i+1}}<th ng-repeat="...">{{x+1}}</th></tr>

3 - FILTERING REPEATERS
the input gets classified as an ng-model named 'query'
Search: <input ng-model="query">

in the list element, the <li> uses ng-repeat and is defined to repeat the 'phone in phones' and filter by the text input 

from the model 'query'
<li ng-repeat="phone in phones | filter:query">
then the values of {{phone.name}} and {{phone.snippet}} are placed in the elements that will be repeated
        <li ng-repeat="phone in phones | filter:query">
          {{phone.name}}
          <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
	</li>

by moving the ng-controller to the html tag with the ng-app, adding {{query}} to <title> tag, updating scenarios.js for 

e2e testing, verifies that title was properly upated with {{query}} from the input ng-model="query". testing defined this 

with expect(browser.getTitle()).toMatch(...)
while adding {{query}} to the title works fine, using <title ng-bind-template="Google Phone Gallery: {{query}}"> ensures 

the angular code is invisible while the page is loading.
